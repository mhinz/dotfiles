  "There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. -- C.A.R. Hoare",
  "Gott existiert, weil die Mathematik widerspruchsfrei ist, und der Teufel existiert, weil wir das nicht beweisen können. -- Andre Weil",

  "If you don't start with a spec, every piece of code you write is a patch. -- Leslie Lamport",
  "Caches are bugs waiting to happen. -- Rob Pike",
  "Abstraction is not about vagueness, it is about being precise at a new semantic level. -- Dijkstra",

  "Make Quality a Requirements Issue\n\nInvolve your users in determining the project’s real quality requirements.",
  "Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear\n\nDon’t be swayed by vendors, media hype, or dogma. Analyze information in terms of you and your project.",

  "Estimate the Order of Your Algorithms\n\nGet a feel for how long things are likely to take before you write code.",
  "Refactor Early, Refactor Often\n\nJust as you might weed and rearrange a garden, rewrite, rework, and re-architect code when it needs it. Fix the root of the problem.",
  "Test Your Software, or Your Users Will\n\nTest ruthlessly. Don’t make your users find bugs for you.",
  "Don’t Gather Requirements—Dig for Them\n\nRequirements rarely lie on the surface. They’re buried deep beneath layers of assumptions, misconceptions, and politics.",
  "Abstractions Live Longer than Details\n\nInvest in the abstraction, not the implementation. Abstractions can survive the barrage of changes from different implementations and new technologies.",
  "Don’t Think Outside the Box—Find the Box\n\nWhen faced with an impossible problem, identify the real constraints. Ask yourself: \"Does it have to be done this way? Does it have to be done at all?\"",
  "Some Things Are Better Done than Described\n\nDon’t fall into the specification spiral—at some point you need to start coding.",
  "Costly Tools Don’t Produce Better Designs\n\nBeware of vendor hype, industry dogma, and the aura of the price tag. Judge tools on their merits.",

  "Coding Ain’t Done ‘Til All the Tests Run\n\n‘Nuff said.",
  "Test State Coverage, Not Code Coverage\n\nIdentify and test significant program states. Just testing lines of code isn’t enough.",

  "It’s Both What You Say and the Way You Say It\n\nThere’s no point in having great ideas if you don’t communicate them effectively.",
  "Make It Easy to Reuse\n\nIf it’s easy to reuse, people will. Create an environment that supports reuse.",
  "There Are No Final Decisions\n\nNo decision is cast in stone. Instead, consider each as being written in the sand at the beach, and plan for change.",
  "Prototype to Learn\n\nPrototyping is a learning experience. Its value lies not in the code you produce, but in the lessons you learn.",
  "Estimate to Avoid Surprises\n\nEstimate before you start. You’ll spot potential problems up front.",
  "Keep Knowledge in Plain Text\n\nPlain text won’t become obsolete. It helps leverage your work and simplifies debugging and testing.",
